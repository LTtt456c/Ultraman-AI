#Ultraman-AI

Ultraman-AI is an artificial intelligence-based Ultraman knowledge base system, which integrates Ultraman's Knowledge Graph, character relationship graph, and supports question answering function based on real-time query. Through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, users can obtain Ultraman-related knowledge information at any time.
